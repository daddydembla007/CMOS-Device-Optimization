The CMOS inverter, the smallest and most widely used logic circuit in CMOS technology, serves as the focus of this work. The goal is to predict and optimize the inverter design, including Width (W), Length (L), and Number of Transistors (N), to meet specified power and delay requirements for advanced Nanosheet FET and CFET-based technologies. 
The work includes the following steps:- 


(a) Develop an analytical model for inverter delay and power as functions of key parameters such as effective current and capacitance.

(b) Validate the analytical model through mixed-mode simulations to ensure accuracy and reliability under various operating conditions.

Further Work:-
(a) Build a deep neural network (DNN)-based forward model to predict current and capacitance values for given inverter design parameters (W, L, N).

(b) Implement advanced optimization techniques such as grid search, Bayesian optimization, or evolutionary algorithms to achieve efficient inverse design for the desired power and delay requirements. 

This approach leverages a combination of analytical modeling, simulation, and machine learning to enable accurate and efficient design optimization for next-generation CMOS technologies.
